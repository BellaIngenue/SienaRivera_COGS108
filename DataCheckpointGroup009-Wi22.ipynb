    "  - **Description:** This dataset contains data and information on Annual Summary of Air Quality through years before 2000 until today. All Data use AQI (Air Quality Index) when applicable. The Measurement AQI is calculated based on the average concentration of a particular pollutant measured over a standard time interval (24 hours for most pollutants, 8 hours for carbon monoxide and ozone). We will be using this dataset to help understand and show the trend of Air Quality throughout years 2007 until today. This way, we can get a trend of how AQI has changed over the years before and through COVID-19.\n",

This dataset contains data and information on Annual Average Daily Traffic Volumes through years 2017 until 2022. This and the following Datasets are the same kind of data but with different years. We will be using this dataset to help understand the average amount of Annual daily traffic through the California area. Although this dataset is more narrow, this will help us have a more narrow scope of information. In comparison to the one below which is the former years. In addition to gathering and cleaning this dataset, we will also be computing the average (mean) of the (Back and Forward Traffic) columns.\n",

We will be cleaning the data and only provide data through years 2011 until 2020 to fit our research question time frame. We will be using this dataset to help understand the usage of gasoline throughout California, and use this to find a correlation to the Air Quality throughout California. Although the data is relatively clean, there are some changes we would like to make to make it easier to understand and work with. Since this dataset has the perfect time frame relative to what we are researching, it will provide our group the 10 years of data necessary to find meaningful relationships. Through this, we can get an idea of how Gasoline Sales Data has changed over the years prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how this has ultimately affected the AQI throughout California.\n",

From there, we want to look further into the addition of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Our team will be analyzing the causal relationship between the effects of COVID-19 on Air Quality stemming from a change in Car and Vehicular Traffic as well as a change in Gasoline sales. All of our information will be combined into one, larger dataset for the California Area. To answer our Research Question, our main priority is getting all of our data cleaned and ready for analysis."

The chosen dataset contains data and information on Annual Gasoline Sales Volumes per City throughout the years 2010 until 2020, however, we will be cleaning the data and only provide data through years 2011 until 2020. We will be using this dataset to help understand the usage of gasoline throughout California, and use this to find a correlation to the Air Quality. Although the data is relatively clean, there are some changes we would like to make to make it easier to understand and work with. Through this, we can get an idea of how Gasoline Sales Data has changed over the years prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and how this has ultimately affected the AQI throughout California.\n"
