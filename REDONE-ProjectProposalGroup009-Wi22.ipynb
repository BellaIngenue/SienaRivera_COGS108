    "As a society we have all been incredibly affected by the COVID-19 Pandemic, our group thought it would be interesting to check the differences in Air Quality from (2011-2022) specifically in the State of California due to the pandemic and the change in the car traffic volume. Since Air Quality affects every single creature on this planet earth, we want to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the quality of the air we breathe every day. By narrowing our region and time down, we should be able to find information and data to help provide a better conclusion to our posed Research Question. As a collective, we agreed that this project could provide information for society to learn from.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2019, governments across the world have issued stay-at-home lockdown orders to help reduce the number of COVID-19 cases.  Consequently, the car traffic volume has significantly decreased since many companies and manufacturers switched to remote work or were closed during the pandemic, a lot of people stayed home due to the fact that some of them decided to not work for a while, and some did their job online. Similarly, all schools, colleges, and universities switched to remote instruction. One of the positive impacts of remote jobs and instruction is less commuting to work and school, and therefore less carbon pollution in the air. “Remote working means fewer people are on the roads. As mentioned, the transport sector is among the number one producers of greenhouse gases. When people work from home, it means less fossil fuel combustion and better air quality”[<sup>1</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Car traffic has a significant role in air pollution. “In urban areas, traffic is one of the major sources of air pollutants. The mixture of vehicle exhausts, secondary pollutants formed in the atmosphere, evaporative emissions from vehicles, and non-combustion emissions (e.g., road dust, tire wear) is referred to as traffic-related air pollution (TRAP)” [<sup>2</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this, we hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on air quality in the state of California. \n",
    "\n",
    "Air quality is a major factor when it comes to health, and air pollution is a risk to health. Breathing clean air will decrease the number of diseases like heart diseases, stroke, asthma, and lung cancer so knowing what affects the quality of air is important. Across the world, life has incredibly changed due to COVID-19 and the stressors the pandemic has put on everyone. In regards to COVID-19, there are many variables that could be affecting air quality, but our group focuses on car traffic and how its change affected air quality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**What has already been done on this topic?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have been done across the world that have looked at the overall changes in air quality since COVID-19. These studies show that air quality has improved during the pandemic.\n",
    "These studies show that air pollutants like NO2 and PM2.5 have significantly decreased during the pandemic and therefore improved the quality of the air. “Before stay-at-home orders were issued March 16, Zhu said, the EPA’s Air Quality Index, which incorporates multiple air pollutants, including NO2 and PM2.5 (fine particulate matter), was about 60, or in the “moderate” category. Since then, it has improved by about 20 percent and recorded the longest stretch of “good” air quality in March seen since at least 1995” [<sup>3</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study called Effect of COVID-19 on air quality and pollution in different countries, states that the spread of COVID-19 and the lockdown led to a decrease in pollutants levels in the air and therefore improved air quality in industrial countries. [<sup>4</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study called 2020 COVID-19 lockdown and the impacts on air quality with emphasis on urban, suburban and rural zones.   This study shows an improvement in the quality of the air in different areas like rural and urban across the countries. [<sup>5</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    " One study is Air Quality Across Countries in Covid-19 which includes different countries around the world and is for the years 2020-2021.[<sup>6</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "Another study is called Breathe India: COVID-19 effect on Pollution which only studied lockdown effect in India[<sup>7</sup>](#fn1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Several studies have been done about air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic, However, our group wanted to specialize in a smaller portion and just focus on the State of California.\n",

All of our datasets for our variables: Air Quality, COVID-19 Rates, Tax Income, and Job Titles are from Kaggle, EPA and EIA. Which are all open to the public for viewing, education and for use. \n",

This data is publicly available through government websites and is free from personally identifiable information, which protects us from many privacy concerns that we may otherwise need to be worried about. Given that none of the air quality data was ever associated with an individial, we believe that this would be safe to legally use. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for the data regarding industries across the state of California, any data we find regarding this will be cleaned and sorted to make sure that any personal identifying information that could associate any individuals with any particular job will be removed and anonymized. We are looking for this data through websites such as Kaggle or Our World in Data and through government websites that provide open-source, free use datasets, so we expect that we shouldn't run into too many complications with privacy, as much of the data has already been released to adhere to data privacy laws.\n",

    "**Are there potential biases in your dataset(s), in terms of who it composes, and how it was collected, that may be problematic in terms of it allowing for equitable analysis?**\n",

    "Looking ahead at the kind of datasets we will be using, it is possible that there could exist potential biases. In air quality data for the state of California, it is possible that some areas are underrepresented or misrepresented due to either a) a lack of adequate air quality measurement tools or b) air quality measurement tools being placed in non-ideal locations for a fair assessment of the actual air quality of the local region. Depending on the average wealth and population of the region, there could be a difference in care of how the data was gathered, which may lead to biased results.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data about industries in California, we will likely use census information or data gathered by a third party associating certain regions with certain industries, so the biases we must be cognizant of are who the data was collected by and for what purpose. We think that census data should be largely free of bias given that the point is simply gather information about the citizenry, but if we are looking into datasets collected by third parties, we must also be aware of why the data was gathered in the first place. If the data was gathered for a biased purpose, such as looking into which industries are \"best\" in California by an agricultural group, we should be wary of using that data because of the biases that may come with it. Thus, we will look into finding datasets that have data about California regional industries gathered for a non-biased purpose.\n",
